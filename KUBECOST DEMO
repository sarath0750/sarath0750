Documentation of Kubecost Implementation 



                          : You need sufficient permissions in the Kubernetes cluster to create namespaces, deployments, .Prerequisites for installing kubecost
    
   1 -Kubernetes cluster:

                      	:	A running Kubernetes cluster (v1.18 or later is recommended). You can use any Kubernetes distribution, such as Minikube, GKE, EKS, AKS, etc.


  2- Kubectl:


                          : The Kubernetes command-line tool must be installed and configured to interact with your cluster. You can check if it’s installed by running:
                                      kubectl version --client

    3- Permissions: 

services, and other resources.                                  


    4-Metrics provider:
                
                         : Ensure that a metrics provider like Prometheus is running in your cluster, as Kubecost requires metrics to function correctly.



   Installation steps           

  1: Create the kubecost namespace using:
                                                                         
                                          “ kubectl create namespace kubecost”


  2: Apply the Kubecost Manifests:

                                         You can use the following command to apply the necessary manifests directly from the Kubecost GitHub repository. These manifests will create all the required resources:

                
                                       “kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubecost/cost-analyzer/releases/latest/download/kubecost.yaml”


 3: Verify the installation: Check the status of the Kubecost pods to ensure they are running:
 
                                 “kubectl get pods -n kubecost”

  4: Access the Kubecost UI: After installation, you can access the Kubecost UI by port-forwarding:

                                 “kubectl port-forward --namespace kubecost service/kubecost-cost-analyzer 9090:80”

                         		Then open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:9090.




        The flow of data involving Kubecost, the OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector, and the Mimir endpoint.




            Data Flow Overview

1  :Data generation: Kubecost generates cost-related metrics from your Kubernetes cluster

2  :Data Export to OpenTelemetry Collector:  Kubecost sends these metrics to the OpenTelemetry collector.


3  :Data Processing: The OTel collector processes the data (optional transformations or filtering).

4:  Data Export to Mimir: Finally, the processed metrics are sent to Mimir for long-term storage and querying.




                 Flow of Data with Contract

1: Data Generation in Kubecost
* Source: Kubecost is configured in a Kubernetes environment and collects metrics related to resource usage, costs, and other relevant financial data.
* Metrics Collected:
    * Resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.)
    * Cost allocation per namespace, pod, service, etc.

2:Pushing Data to OpenTelemetry Collector
* Configuration: Ensure that Kubecost is configured to export metrics to the OTel collector. This typically involves modifying the Kubecost deployment YAML to include the OTel collector endpoint.
* Contract: The metrics are sent using a specific format (usually Prometheus exposition format or OpenTelemetry protocol).


 3. Data Processing by OpenTelemetry Collector
* Input Configuration: The OTel collector should be set up to receive data from Kubecost.
* Processing: The collector can perform actions such as:
    * Aggregation of metrics
    * Filtering of unnecessary data
    * Enrichment with additional labels or tags 
 


          Example OTel Collector Configuration:
                                
                receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'kubecost'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['kubecost-service:8080']

exporters:
  mimir:
    endpoint: "http://mimir-endpoint:9000/api/v1/push"

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      exporters: [mimir]


    4: Exporting Data to Mimir          
        

       Configuration: Ensure the OTel collector is configured with the appropriate Mimir endpoint.
Data Format: Metrics are typically sent in a format that Mimir can accept (e.g., OpenTelemetry Protocol).
Verification: After configuration, monitor logs and metrics to confirm that data is flowing correctly to Mimir.

 
   Summary of the Flow
1. Kubecost collects and generates metrics related to Kubernetes costs.
2. Kubecost pushes this data to the OpenTelemetry Collector configured with the appropriate endpoint.
3. The OpenTelemetry Collector processes the data and exports it to Mimir.
4. Mimir stores the metrics for long-term analys
     


    Monitoring and Validation
* Logging: Check logs of both Kubecost and the OTel collector for any errors during data transmission.
* Mimir Dashboard: Validate that the metrics are visible in Mimir through Grafana or other visualization tools.

           
                 Integration of Otel Collector and Mimir
   
 



1:Create Mimir Namespace:
 

           "kubectl create namespace mimir"
  


2:Deploy Mimir: You can deploy Mimir using a YAML manifest. Create a file called mimir-deployment.yaml and add the following:


                  apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mimir
  namespace: mimir
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mimir
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mimir
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mimir
        image: grafana/mimir:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9009
        # Add any required environment variables or configurations here

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mimir
  namespace: mimir
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 9009
    targetPort: 9009
  selector:
    app: mimir

    

     Apply the YAML File
          
    
Now that you have created the YAML file, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster. Make sure the mimir namespace exists first:
 
“kubectl create namespace mimir”


Then, apply the deployment and service:

“ kubectl apply -f mimir-deployment.yaml”

   

    Verify the Deployment and Service


Check Deployments: 
       
“kubectl get deployments -n mimir”


Check Pods:

“kubectl get pods -n mimir”

Check Services:

“kubectl get svc -n mimir”


 Configure Kubecost to Push Data to Mimir

    1: Modify Kubecost Configuration: Update your Kubecost configuration to send metrics to Mimir. You’ll need to set the MIMIR_ENDPOINT in your Kubecost deployment.

2:Add Environment Variables: Edit your Kubecost deployment: 
     
  “kubectl edit deployment kubecost-cost-analyzer -n kubecost”
     
Add the following environment variable under the spec.containers section:
  
env:
  - name: MIMIR_ENDPOINT
    value: "http://mimir.mimir.svc.cluster.local:9009"


3: Restart Kubecost: After editing the deployment, restart Kubecost to apply the changes.: 
  
   “kubectl rollout restart deployment kubecost-cost-analyzer -n kubecost”
   


Verify the Setup:
 
Check Mimir Logs: Verify that Mimir is receiving data. You can check the logs with:
  
“kubectl logs -l app=mimir -n mimir”




Setup Otel Collector:

1.create namespace for Otel Collector


  “kubectl create namespace otel-collector”



2.create the Otel collector configuration 


 Create a configuration file for the OTel Collector. This file defines how the collector gathers and exports metrics. Save the following YAML as otel-collector-config.yaml: 
                                     receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'mimir'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['<mimir-service>:<mimir-port>']  # Replace with your Mimir service address and port

exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: ":9090"  # Export to a Prometheus endpoint
    namespace: "otel"

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      exporters: [prometheus]


 3.create a configmap for Otel

create a ConfigMap from the configuration file:

“kubectl create configmap otel-collector-config --from-file=otel-collector-config.yaml -n otel-collector”


4.create the Otel deployment:

                        Create a deployment YAML file called otel-collector-deployment.yaml:

                           apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: otel-collector
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: otel-collector
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: otel-collector
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: otel-collector
          image: otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest
          args: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector-config/otel-collector-config.yaml"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /etc/otel-collector-config
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: otel-collector-config


5.Deploy the collector

apply the deployment configuration:

       “ kubectl apply -f otel-collector-deployment.yaml”

6.Expose the collector 


         If you need to expose the OTel Collector to access it from outside the cluster, create a service:

                  apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
  namespace: otel-collector
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 9090
      targetPort: 9090
  selector:
    app: otel-collector 

Save this as otel-collector-service.yaml and apply it:

 “ kubectl apply -f otel-collector-service.yaml”

   




 Integrate with Kubecost
Finally, configure Kubecost to scrape metrics from the OTel Collector:
1. Update the Kubecost Configuration: Add the OTel Collector as a metrics source in the Kubecost configuration. This typically involves modifying the Kubecost configuration YAML or ConfigMap to include the OTel Collector endpoint.
2. Reload or Restart Kubecost: Depending on how you've configured Kubecost, you may need to restart it or apply the updated configuration for it to pick up the changes.


Verify the Integration
* Check the logs of both the OTel Collector and Kubecost to ensure that metrics are being successfully collected and exported.
* Access the Kubecost UI to confirm that you can see the data being ingested from Mimir through the OTel Collector.
